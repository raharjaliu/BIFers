The format is such that there is first a line with the UniProt ID and sequence followed by lines with PDB IDs, PDB chain IDs, the sequence from the PDB entry aligned to the UniProt sequence, and a string of equal length where the positions which bind DNA/RNA are marked with a '!'. UniProt entries are separated by lines that contain just "$$".

The UniProt sequence is the sequence we will use for training in the end, so if you redundancy reduce the set, you do this based on the UniProt sequence. And if a residue in the UniProt sequence is annotated as binding in any of the aligned structures, then we consider that residue binding.
